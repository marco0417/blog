- 103 条我希望我年轻时就知道的智慧：
	- **大约 99% 的情况下，正确开始的时间就是现在。**
	- 别人不会像你一样对你的财产印象深刻。（Morgan Housel《金钱心理学》里面的一句话，可粗浅理解为禀赋效应）
	- 永远不要为你不想成为的人工作。
	- 培养 12 个爱你的人，他们比 1200 万个喜欢你的人更有价值。
	- 不要一直犯同样的错误，做新的试错。
	- 如果你驻足欣赏音乐家或街头艺人表演超过一分钟，你就欠他们一美元。
	- **在「但是」一词之前说的任何话都不算数**
	- 原谅别人时，对方可能不会注意，但你自己会被治愈。宽恕不为他人，是给自己的礼物。
	- 礼貌无价。用完马桶后把盖子放下，等电梯时先出后进，把购物车放回指定区域。借东西归还时要比你得到时的状态更好（装满，清洁）。
	- 两方发生争执时，找第三方。
	- **效率被高估了，偷懒被严重低估了。定期安排的休息日、假期、轮休、漫无目的的散步和休息时间对于任何类型的最佳表现都是必不可少的。最好的职业道德包括良好的休息道德。**
	- **当你领导群体时，真正的工作是创造更多领导者，而不是更多的追随者。**
	- 私下批评，公开表扬。
	- 人生的每一门课程会随时间依次呈现给你。掌握所需的一切能力取决于你的内心。真正吸取一次教训，你就会面临下一个挑战。如果你生存了下来，那意味着你还将得到教训。
	- 从老师那里得到一切知识是学生的责任，而老师也有责任从学生身上学到一切。
	- 如果在一场比赛中获胜变得过于重要，那就改变规则并让它变得更有趣。改变规则本身也可以是新的比赛。
	- **求人赞助，他们会给你建议；向别人寻求建议，他们会给你钱。**
	- 生产力通常会有误区。不要以更快完成任务为导向，而要以更好完成任务为目标，寻找你想一直做下去的事。
	- 即时向供应商、工人、承包商支付你所欠的款项。他们下次才会不遗余力地优先与你合作。
	- **我们对自己说的最大的谎是「不需要写下来，我能记住」。**
	- 作为意识体，成长是由你愿意进行的不舒服谈话的数量来衡量的。
	- 说话要自信，就好像你是对的，但同时要仔细听，就好像你是错的。
	- 简单的测量：伸平手臂与肩同高，两个指尖的距离就是你的身高。
	- 努力（锻炼、陪伴、工作）的一致性比数量更重要。没有什么比每天做的小事更重要了，这比你偶尔做的事情更重要。
	- 做艺术不是自私的；它是为他人服务的。如果你不做你的事，你就是在欺骗我们。
	- 永远不要问一个女人是否怀孕。她愿意的话会主动告诉你。
	- 你需要三种品质：不放弃某件事情直到最终成功，放弃做无用功，以及信任其他人来帮助你区分这两种情况的能力。
	- 公开演讲时，要经常停顿。在你以新的方式说某件事情之前暂停，在你说了你认为重要的事情之后暂停，并将暂停作为一种解脱，让听众吸收细节。
	- 没有所谓的「准时」之说，你要么迟到，要么提前。你需要做出选择。
	- 问问那些你钦佩的人：他们的运气时常出现在远离主要目标的弯道上。所以接受走弯路。对任何人来说，生活都不是一条直线。
	- 在互联网上获得正确答案的最好方法是发布一个明显错误的答案，并等待有人来纠正你。（以维基百科作者坎宁安命名的定律，维基百科可能是本定律的最佳例子。）
	- 通过奖励好的行为而不是惩罚坏的行为，你会得到 10 倍的效果，特别是在儿童和动物身上。
	- 花尽可能多的时间精心设计电子邮件的主题行，因为它往往是人们阅读的唯一内容。
	- 生活不是等待暴风雨过去，而是要学会在雨中起舞。
	- 查看求职者推荐信时要意识到，雇主可能不愿意或被禁止说任何负面的东西，所以留下或发送一条信息说：「如果你强烈推荐这个求职者，他是超级棒的，请给我回信。」如果他们不回复，就当作是一种否定。
	- 使用密码管理器：它们更安全、更简单、更强大。
	- 接受教育学到的一半技能，是让你学会可以忽略一些东西。
	- 设立大目标的优势在于，制定非常高的标准，即使失败，也可能是普通人眼里的成功。
	- **了解自己的一个好方法是认真地反思别人身上让你反感的一切。**
	- 在酒店房间里要把你所有的东西都放在显眼的位置，集中到一个地方，不要放在抽屉里。这样你就不会落下任何东西。如果你需要把充电器之类的东西放在一边，就在它旁边放几件其他的大件物品，拉下三件物品的可能性比只拉下一件小。
	- 拒绝或回避赞美是不礼貌的。即使你认为它不值得，也要感谢地接受它。
	- 始终记得阅读纪念碑旁边的牌匾。
	- 当你有一点成绩的时候，自己是冒牌者的感觉可能是真的。我在愚弄谁呢？但当你创造出只有你—以独特才能和经验—才能做到的事情时，那么你绝对不是冒牌货。这是天命所归。在只有你能做的事情上努力是你的职责。
	- 在逆境中的表现，比你在顺境里所做的更重要。
	- 做对他人有益的事。
	- 当你打开油漆，哪怕只用一丁点，无论你多么小心，它总会沾到你的衣服。准备好着装。
	- **为了让小孩子们在汽车旅行中表现良好，准备一袋他们最喜欢的糖果，每当他们不听话时，就向窗外扔一块。**
	- 你无法让聪明人仅仅为了钱而奋力工作。
	- 当你不知道该为某项任务付给某人多少钱时，问他「怎样才算公平？」，他们的回答通常就是该有的价格。
	- 90% 的东西都没有意义。如果你认为自己不喜欢歌剧、爱情小说、TikTok、乡村音乐、素食、NFT，保持尝试，看看是否能找到有意义的 10%。
	- 人们会根据你对那些和你无利益冲突的人的态度好坏来评价你。
	- 我们倾向于高估自己一天内能做的事，又低估自己在十年内能取得的成就。十年时间足以完成奇迹般的大事。一场漫长的比赛包含众多小目标，积累之后形成量变。
	- 感谢那位改变了你一生的老师。
	- 你不可能用别人无法理解的逻辑给别人讲道理。
	- 最好的工作可能是你不能胜任的工作，因为它会最大限度利用你的能力。所以请申请你不能胜任的工作。
	- 买旧书。他们有和新书一样的字。也可以去图书馆。
	- 你可以做任何你想做的事，所以做一个提前结束会议的人。
	- 智者说：在你说话之前，让你的话通过三道门。在第一个大门问自己「这是真的吗？」 在第二道门前问「有必要吗？」在第三道门前问「是好的吗？」
	- 走楼梯。
	- **你为某样东西实际支付的费用至少是其标价的两倍，因为你需要花费时间精力和钱来设置、学习、维护、修理，以及最终的处置。不是所有的价格都体现在标签上。实际成本是标价的 2 倍。**
	- 当你到达酒店的房间时，确认紧急出口。这只需要一分钟时间。
	- 回答「我现在应该做什么？」的唯一有效方式是首先解决「我应该成为谁？」的问题。
	- 在高于平均水平的时间内持续的平均水平回报会产生非凡的效果。请买长线。
	- 对无礼的陌生人保持极致风度是很令人感动的。
	- 一个不太聪明但容易沟通的人，可能比一个超级聪明但难以沟通的人做得更好。这是件好事，因为提高你的沟通能力比提高你的智力要容易得多。
	- 偶尔受骗是相信每个人的优点的小代价，因为当你相信别人的优点时，他们通常也会给你最好的回报。
	- 艺术的表现形式是无穷无尽的。
	- 要想在孩子身上取得最好的效果，只花你认为应该花的一半的钱，但花双倍的时间陪他们在一起。
	- **购买最新的本地旅游指南。每年扮演一次游客，你会学到很多东西。**
	- 不要排队等候吃著名的东西，一般都不值得。
	- 想要迅速弄清新认识的一个人的真实性格，让他们连接到一个慢得不能再慢的网络上。观察一下。
	- 世俗化成功的处方：做一些奇怪的事情。让你的怪异成为一种习惯。
	- 备份你的备份。至少要有一个物理备份和一个云端的备份，两者最好都有多于一个备份。如果你丢失了你的所有数据、照片、笔记，你会花多少钱来找回它们？与遗憾相比，备份很便宜。
	- **不要相信你认为自己相信的一切。**
	- 想要发出紧急信号，使用三法则；3 声喊叫、3 声喇叭声或 3 声口哨声。
	- 在餐厅，您会点一些你知道好吃的东西，还是尝试一些新的东西？探索新事物与利用新事物的最佳平衡是：1:3。将 1/3 的时间用于探索，将 2/3 的时间用于深化。随着年龄的增长，更难花时间去探索，因为它似乎没有成效，目标就成了剩下的 1/3。
	- 真正的好机会不容易找到，更不会明码标注出来。
	- 与某人初次见面并作介绍时，要与对方有眼神接触并默数到 4，这样你们都会记住对方。
	- 如果你发现自己在想 「我的好刀（或者我的好笔）在哪里」，这意味着你有其他坏的东西，把它们扔掉。
	- 当你陷入困境时，尝试向别人解释你的问题。通常当你提出问题的时候就能找到一个解决方案。解释问题是解决困境的一种方法。
	- 在购买花园水管、延长线或梯子时，要买一个比你认为需要的长得多的，那才是正确的尺寸。
	- 不必费心地与旧事物抗争，只需要创造新事物。
	- 只需要给别人以赞赏，他们就能取得超出能力范围的伟大成就。
	- 说起一段历史，巅峰之年总是第十几年，就像每个人十多岁的时候，那是每个人最好的年华。
	- **从让一个人生气的事情大小就能看出一个人的价值。（这是丘吉尔的名言）**
	- 当你面向听众表达自己的观点时，最好将目光集中在几个人身上，而不是扫向整个房间，你的眼神代表你是否相信自己所说的话。
	- 习惯远比一时兴起可靠得多，你需要养成习惯才能获得进步。就像健身锻炼，不要专注于塑形，而是要成为从不错过锻炼的人。
	- 谈判时，不要以争取更大的蛋糕为目标，要以创造一个更大的蛋糕为目标。
	- 如果你把今天所做的事情重复 365 次，明年你会成为你想成为的人吗？
	- 你只能看到一个人的 2%，同样他们也只能看到你的 2%，你需要隐藏自己的 98%。
	- **你的时间和空间是有限的，移除、舍弃、扔掉那些已无法让你快乐的事物，以便为新的快乐腾出空间。**
	- 我们的后代将取得令我们震惊的突破，如果我们有足够的想象力，可以设想一下他们利用目前已有的条件能够创造出什么，可以大胆猜测一下。
	- 如果你想获得丰厚的回报，那么即使是不感兴趣的事，你也要充满好奇。
	- 专注于方向而不是目的地。没有人能知道自己的命运，但坚持朝着正确的方向努力，你就会到达想去的地方。
	- 每一个突破最开始都是荒谬可笑的，事实上如果它最开始不荒谬，那它就算不上突破。
	- 如果你借给别人 20 美元，而他为了不还钱选择不再见你，那你们的关系只值 20 美元。
	- 复制他人的成功是一个好的开始，复制自己是一个令人失望的结束。
	- 为一份新工作谈判薪资的最佳时机是对方想要你之后，而不是之前。然后，双方都说出一个数字就成了一场博弈，但在你工作之前让雇佣者给出一个薪资水平对你来说是有益的。
	- 与其躲避生活中的意外，不如直接面对这些风险。
	- 如果你使用信用卡租车，不要购买额外的保险。
	- 如果你对一个问题的观点能够从你对另一个问题的观点中预测出来，那么你可能正处于某种意识形态的掌控之中。实际上当你真正独立地思考一个问题，你的结论很难被预测。
	- **争取在离世之前花光自己所有的钱。相比于给你的受益人，自己全部花光更有趣也更有意义。你填的最后一张支票应该是给殡仪馆，还应该拒付。**
	- **防止变老的主要方法是对新鲜事物保持好奇和惊讶。**

	- • About 99% of the time, the right time is right now.
	- • No one is as impressed with your possessions as you are.
	- • Dont ever work for someone you dont want to become.
	- • Cultivate 12 people who love you, because they are worth more than 12 million people who like you.
	- • Dont keep making the same mistakes; try to make new mistakes.
	- • If you stop to listen to a musician or street performer for more than a minute, you owe them a dollar.
	- • Anything you say before the word “but” does not count.
	- • When you forgive others, they may not notice, but you will heal. Forgiveness is not something we do for others; it is a gift to ourselves.
	- • Courtesy costs nothing. Lower the toilet seat after use. Let the people in the elevator exit before you enter. Return shopping carts to their designated areas. When you borrow something, return it better shape (filled up, cleaned) than when you got it.
	- • Whenever there is an argument between two sides, find the third side.
	- • Efficiency is highly overrated; Goofing off is highly underrated. Regularly scheduled sabbaths, sabbaticals, vacations, breaks, aimless walks and time off are essential for top performance of any kind. The best work ethic requires a good rest ethic.
	- • When you lead, your real job is to create more leaders, not more followers.
	- • Criticize in private, praise in public.
	- • Life lessons will be presented to you in the order they are needed. Everything you need to master the lesson is within you. Once you have truly learned a lesson, you will be presented with the next one. If you are alive, that means you still have lessons to learn.
	- • It is the duty of a student to get everything out of a teacher, and the duty of a teacher to get everything out of a student.
	- • If winning becomes too important in a game, change the rules to make it more fun. Changing rules can become the new game.
	- • Ask funders for money, and they’ll give you advice; but ask for advice and they’ll give you money.
	- • Productivity is often a distraction. Don’t aim for better ways to get through your tasks as quickly as possible, rather aim for better tasks that you never want to stop doing.
	- • Immediately pay what you owe to vendors, workers, contractors. They will go out of their way to work with you first next time.
	- • The biggest lie we tell ourselves is “I dont need to write this down because I will remember it.”
	- • Your growth as a conscious being is measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations you are willing to have.
	- • Speak confidently as if you are right, but listen carefully as if you are wrong.
	- • Handy measure: the distance between your fingertips of your outstretched arms at shoulder level is your height.
	- • The consistency of your endeavors (exercise, companionship, work) is more important than the quantity. Nothing beats small things done every day, which is way more important than what you do occasionally.
	- • Making art is not selfish; it’s for the rest of us. If you don’t do your thing, you are cheating us.
	- • Never ask a woman if she is pregnant. Let her tell you if she is.
	- • Three things you need: The ability to not give up something till it works, the ability to give up something that does not work, and the trust in other people to help you distinguish between the two.
	- • When public speaking, pause frequently. Pause before you say something in a new way, pause after you have said something you believe is important, and pause as a relief to let listeners absorb details.
	- • There is no such thing as being “on time.” You are either late or you are early. Your choice.
	- • Ask anyone you admire: Their lucky breaks happened on a detour from their main goal. So embrace detours. Life is not a straight line for anyone.
	- • The best way to get a correct answer on the internet is to post an obviously wrong answer and wait for someone to correct you.
	- • You’ll get 10x better results by elevating good behavior rather than punishing bad behavior, especially in children and animals.
	- • Spend as much time crafting the subject line of an email as the message itself because the subject line is often the only thing people read.
	- • Don’t wait for the storm to pass; dance in the rain.
	- • When checking references for a job applicant, employers may be reluctant or prohibited from saying anything negative, so leave or send a message that says, “Get back to me if you highly recommend this applicant as super great.” If they don’t reply take that as a negative.
	- • Use a password manager: Safer, easier, better.
	- • Half the skill of being educated is learning what you can ignore.
	- • The advantage of a ridiculously ambitious goal is that it sets the bar very high so even in failure it may be a success measured by the ordinary.
	- • A great way to understand yourself is to seriously reflect on everything you find irritating in others.
	- • Keep all your things visible in a hotel room, not in drawers, and all gathered into one spot. That way you’ll never leave anything behind. If you need to have something like a charger off to the side, place a couple of other large items next to it, because you are less likely to leave 3 items behind than just one.
	- • Denying or deflecting a compliment is rude. Accept it with thanks, even if you believe it is not deserved.
	- • Always read the plaque next to the monument.
	- • When you have some success, the feeling of being an imposter can be real. Who am I fooling? But when you create things that only you — with your unique talents and experience — can do, then you are absolutely not an imposter. You are the ordained. It is your duty to work on things that only you can do.
	- • What you do on your bad days matters more than what you do on your good days.
	- • Make stuff that is good for people to have.
	- • When you open paint, even a tiny bit, it will always find its way to your clothes no matter how careful you are. Dress accordingly.
	- • To keep young kids behaving on a car road trip, have a bag of their favorite candy and throw a piece out the window each time they misbehave.
	- • You cannot get smart people to work extremely hard just for money.
	- • When you don’t know how much to pay someone for a particular task, ask them “what would be fair” and their answer usually is.
	- • 90% of everything is crap. If you think you don’t like opera, romance novels, TikTok, country music, vegan food, NFTs, keep trying to see if you can find the 10% that is not crap.
	- • You will be judged on how well you treat those who can do nothing for you.
	- • We tend to overestimate what we can do in a day, and underestimate what we can achieve in a decade. Miraculous things can be accomplished if you give it ten years. A long game will compound small gains to overcome even big mistakes.
	- • Thank a teacher who changed your life.
	- • You cant reason someone out of a notion that they didn’t reason themselves into.
	- • Your best job will be one that you were unqualified for because it stretches you. In fact only apply to jobs you are unqualified for.
	- • Buy used books. They have the same words as the new ones. Also libraries.
	- • You can be whatever you want, so be the person who ends meetings early.
	- • A wise man said, “Before you speak, let your words pass through three gates. At the first gate, ask yourself, “Is it true?” At the second gate ask, “Is it necessary?” At the third gate ask, “Is it kind?”
	- • Take the stairs.
	- • What you actually pay for something is at least twice the listed price because of the energy, time, money needed to set it up, learn, maintain, repair, and dispose of at the end. Not all prices appear on labels. Actual costs are 2x listed prices.
	- • When you arrive at your room in a hotel, locate the emergency exits. It only takes a minute.
	- • The only productive way to answer “what should I do now?” is to first tackle the question of “who should I become?”
	- • Average returns sustained over an above-average period of time yield extraordinary results. Buy and hold.
	- • It’s thrilling to be extremely polite to rude strangers.
	- • It’s possible that a not-so smart person, who can communicate well, can do much better than a super smart person who can’t communicate well. That is good news because it is much easier to improve your communication skills than your intelligence.
	- • Getting cheated occasionally is the small price for trusting the best of everyone, because when you trust the best in others, they generally treat you best.
	- • Art is whatever you can get away with.
	- • For the best results with your children, spend only half the money you think you should, but double the time with them.
	- • Purchase the most recent tourist guidebook to your home town or region. You’ll learn a lot by playing the tourist once a year.
	- • Dont wait in line to eat something famous. It is rarely worth the wait.
	- • To rapidly reveal the true character of a person you just met, move them onto an abysmally slow internet connection. Observe.
	- • Prescription for popular success: do something strange. Make a habit of your weird.
	- • Be a pro. Back up your back up. Have at least one physical backup and one backup in the cloud. Have more than one of each. How much would you pay to retrieve all your data, photos, notes, if you lost them? Backups are cheap compared to regrets.
	- • Dont believe everything you think you believe.
	- • To signal an emergency, use the rule of three; 3 shouts, 3 horn blasts, or 3 whistles.
	- • At a restaurant do you order what you know is great, or do you try something new? Do you make what you know will sell or try something new? Do you keep dating new folks or try to commit to someone you already met? The optimal balance for exploring new things vs exploiting them once found is: 1/3. Spend 1/3 of your time on exploring and 2/3 time on deepening. It is harder to devote time to exploring as you age because it seems unproductive, but aim for 1/3.
	- • Actual great opportunities do not have “Great Opportunities” in the subject line.
	- • When introduced to someone make eye contact and count to 4. You’ll both remember each other.
	- • Take note if you find yourself wondering “Where is my good knife? Or, where is my good pen?” That means you have bad ones. Get rid of those.
	- • When you are stuck, explain your problem to others. Often simply laying out a problem will present a solution. Make “explaining the problem” part of your troubleshooting process.
	- • When buying a garden hose, an extension cord, or a ladder, get one substantially longer than you think you need. It’ll be the right size.
	- • Dont bother fighting the old; just build the new.
	- • Your group can achieve great things way beyond your means simply by showing people that they are appreciated.
	- • When someone tells you about the peak year of human history, the period of time when things were good before things went downhill, it will always be the years of when they were 10 years old — which is the peak of any human’s existence.
	- • You are as big as the things that make you angry.
	- • When speaking to an audience it’s better to fix your gaze on a few people than to “spray” your gaze across the room. Your eyes telegraph to others whether you really believe what you are saying.
	- • Habit is far more dependable than inspiration. Make progress by making habits. Dont focus on getting into shape. Focus on becoming the kind of person who never misses a workout.
	- • When negotiating, dont aim for a bigger piece of the pie; aim to create a bigger pie.
	- • If you repeated what you did today 365 more times will you be where you want to be next year?
	- • You see only 2% of another person, and they see only 2% of you. Attune yourselves to the hidden 98%.
	- • Your time and space are limited. Remove, give away, throw out things in your life that dont spark joy any longer in order to make room for those that do.
	- • Our descendants will achieve things that will amaze us, yet a portion of what they will create could have been made with today’s materials and tools if we had had the imagination. Think bigger.
	- • For a great payoff be especially curious about the things you are not interested in.
	- • Focus on directions rather than destinations. Who knows their destiny? But maintain the right direction and you’ll arrive at where you want to go.
	- • Every breakthrough is at first laughable and ridiculous. In fact if it did not start out laughable and ridiculous, it is not a breakthrough.
	- • If you loan someone $20 and you never see them again because they are avoiding paying you back, that makes it worth $20.
	- • Copying others is a good way to start. Copying yourself is a disappointing way to end.
	- • The best time to negotiate your salary for a new job is the moment AFTER they say they want you, and not before. Then it becomes a game of chicken for each side to name an amount first, but it is to your advantage to get them to give a number before you do.
	- • Rather than steering your life to avoid surprises, aim directly for them.
	- • Dont purchase extra insurance if you are renting a car with a credit card.
	- • If your opinions on one subject can be predicted from your opinions on another, you may be in the grip of an ideology. When you truly think for yourself your conclusions will not be predictable.
	- • Aim to die broke. Give to your beneficiaries before you die; it’s more fun and useful. Spend it all. Your last check should go to the funeral home and it should bounce.
	- • The chief prevention against getting old is to remain astonished.
